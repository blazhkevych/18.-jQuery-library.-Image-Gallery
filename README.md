# 18.-jQuery-library.-Image-Gallery

Create a web page with an image gallery. On
The page must contain thumbnails.
When you hover the mouse cursor over any thumbnail
image, the latter should be highlighted using
some jQuery UI effect. By clicking on the thumbnail
image, its enlarged copy is loaded, replacing
previous image. When changing images,
apply one of the jQuery UI effects.
